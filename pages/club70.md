## Club 70
After years of community interest, on December 21, 1969, a group of twelve people, including Edmontonians Wayne Gordon, Judith Jerace, Stanley Hawkins, Roy Wilson, Janet Wilkinson, and Paul Chisolm, came together to discuss opening a dedicated gay club, intending to find funding for it and navigating the legalities of successfully organizing such a private member’s club dedicated to Edmonton’s gay and lesbian community. On January 4, 1970, an expanded group of 53 people met to continue these community discussions, elect a Board of Directors, adopt by-laws and decided upon a name. Club 70 was originally going to be called Club 69, but that name was thought to be too risqué for the times. Club 70 would become Edmonton’s first formally established gay bar and was officially registered on February 2, 1970.  

Boots ‘n Saddle would later have a long run in this same space once occupied by Club 70. More recently, this historic space was the home of Latitude 53 Gallery. 

Before Club 70, members of Edmonton’s LGBTQ2 community often gathered together clandestinely in houses, apartments, parks, tea rooms (public bathrooms), and other fugitive spaces to find friends, relationships, and spaces of safety. Some places like the King Edward Hotel, as well as the 
Corona, Mayfair, Hotel Macdonald, and Royal George hotels, tolerated same sex patrons so long as they were quiet and unsuspecting.

Club 70 was initially located in the basement of a Greek restaurant on the southeast corner of 101 Street and 106 Avenue, but the club’s presence there was short-lived after the owner discovered what “type of club” it was and demanded Club 70 vacate the premises. "[insert citation 2 here]"
 Since membership information, including the names and addresses of club patrons, was stored in the basement, a few dedicated club members broke in through a window to retrieve the club records and ensure none of the private membership information would be misused or exposed.

 Having club member names made public could have meant losing a person’s job, family, reputation, or worse.
